# Adsorption-Based-Water-Treatment-Simulator
Python-based simulation of adsorption-driven wastewater treatment using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, incorporating mass balances, removal efficiency analysis, and economic optimization.
This project models an adsorption-driven wastewater treatment process using classical chemical engineering principles. The system simulates batch adsorption of a dissolved contaminant onto a solid adsorbent and evaluates performance using both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The objective is to analyze contaminant removal efficiency while optimizing adsorbent usage from an economic perspective.

The project demonstrates how equilibrium relationships, mass balances, and numerical methods can be combined to evaluate real-world separation processes commonly used in environmental and chemical engineering applications.
